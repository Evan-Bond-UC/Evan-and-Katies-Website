# Evan and Katie's Website

##  Creator

Evan Bond

## Description

This project is a brand new website designed to function as a hub and a showcase for the future youtube channel that I plan to create with my girlfriend. It will act as a promotional tool for the page as well as offer links to other social media sites and offer things to do on the page itself to retain viewership. It will show recent videos, links to other sites and social media platforms, suggested shows, polls for what we should watch next, and more.

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Anybody who enjoys the shows we are reacting to who might be interested in finding early access content, or seeing what other shows we are reacting to or plan to react to in the future. 

- **Secondary:** Anybody who enjoys video games and might be interested in our reactions to the video game to show adaptations that have released such as fallout, last of us, arcane, etc. 

## Project Goals

The project goals with this website are to forge a community of loyal subscribers who are more engaged with our content than the average youtube community. It aims to create a hub that can bring everybody together in a better way than the youtube interface, and potentially convert some of those viewers in to paying patreon subscribers or eventually create an "In-house" method of providing early access content for money within this website itself.
